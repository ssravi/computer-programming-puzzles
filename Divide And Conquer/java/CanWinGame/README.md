//Playing a game on an array of numbers;

Problem: An array of numbers are given. Write a program that takes input of array of numbers and a starting index so you have to decide whether you won the game or lost by traversing through the array left or right by arr[index] to find number "0".

Ex: input -> [ 1, 3, 0, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3]

if startingIndex = 4 , arr[4] = 2, you move two steps left which is  arr[0] you won. for input 4, you win.
