Divide And Conquer
===================


In computer science, divide and conquer (D&C) is an important algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. src : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm


This include various recursion based puzzles that could be solved with recursion easily than iterative process.
