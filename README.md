Collaboration for programming puzzles
======================================

Git has set standards for structured collaboration of repositories. Github has become the destination for every serious learner, programmer etc. It's on the path for becoming a central place for code commits and social contribution to open source. In the next few years, it will be used by every other sector for collaborating git commits in business development. Likes of project management, product management, students, learners are already active on github.

Call for Programmers
====================
If you are a computer programmer or an engineer or an architect, this repository is asking your help to help others who wants to learn problem solving by looking at real code. Please come help.
 
Credit
======
Credit for doint this? Simple. It's a public repository on github. Any valid contribution to this repository adds history to your problem solving along with the addition to your github activity. Git hub activity is well received by search engines and it lets the whole world see your work. Also, you are not only helping others by committing interesing programming puzzles in your favorite language but also motivates you to make it a habit.

For learners
============
If you are a learner or preparing for software interviews or, I expect you to know computer science basics and you are here only to learn problem solving by looking at real code. Many people have tried solutions or struggling to cater solutions on different websites. But looking at github's activity growing day by day with opensource contributions, I created this repository to be that single place. 


File Structure
==============
It's pretty basic. The project directory has sub directories which are basics of computer science. Each division has a subdirectory with a programming language directory (Your problems and solutions should go to that specific language directory). If you are writing in a new language, please create a new directory for it and include your instructions for execution in README.md file.

1. Data Structures
    /java
2. Divide and Conquer
    /java
3. Dynamic Programming
    /java
4. Algorithms 
    /java

General Note
============
I am still trying to keep it as basic as possible with the file structure, please use your smart brains to make it better and better with every push and pull requests.

Conclusion
==========
Keep it simple, make it a habit and have fun to help the next generation.
